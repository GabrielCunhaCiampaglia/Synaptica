## About The Project

Digital communication is often filled with nuance, sarcasm, and unwritten rules that can be challenging to navigate. For autistic people, this can lead to misunderstanding, anxiety, and communication barriers.

Synaptica is a mobile app that acts as a bridge, using Artificial Intelligence to:

1.  **Interpret incoming texts:** It analyzes tone, emotion, and hidden meanings to provide a clear explanation.
2.  **Assist with writing replies:** It offers suggestions to help users express their thoughts and feelings accurately and confidently.

Our goal is to provide a tool that fosters understanding, reduces communication-related anxiety, and helps users connect with others authentically.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* An IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/synaptica.git
    cd synaptica
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (C# API):**
    * Navigate to the API directory:
        ```sh
        cd api
        ```
    * Restore dependencies:
        ```sh
        dotnet restore
        ```
    * Configure your environment variables (e.g., API keys for the AI service) in `appsettings.Development.json`.
    * Run the API:
        ```sh
        dotnet run
        ```
    The API should now be running locally at `http://localhost:5000` (or similar).

3.  **Set up the Frontend (Flutter App):**
    * Navigate to the app directory from the root folder:
        ```sh
        cd app
        ```
    * Get Flutter packages:
        ```sh
        flutter pub get
        ```
    * Run the app on your preferred emulator or device:
        ```sh
        flutter run
        ```
